Today, smartphones are everywhere. Almost all students have smartphones. So, should students use smartphones in school? I think this is a hard question to answer.

First, smartphones are very helpful. If students don't know something, they can use smartphones to look for the answer on the internet. It's very fast and easy. And if something bad happens, students can use smartphones to call their mom and dad. This is very important for safety.

But smartphones also have problems. Some students like to play games on smartphones when teachers are teaching. This is very bad for learning. And some students like to talk to friends on WeChat. They don't do homework. This wastes a lot of time.

So I think students can bring smartphones to school, but schools should have rules. Maybe students can only use smartphones during rest time.
