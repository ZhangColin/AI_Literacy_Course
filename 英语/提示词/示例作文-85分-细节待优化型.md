Nowadays, smartphones are very popular. Many students have smartphones. Should students use smartphones in school? I think it's a difficult question.

On one hand, smartphones are useful. Students can use it to search information. When they don't understand something, they can use smartphone to find answer. It's very convenient. Also, students can use smartphones to communicate with parents. If they have emergency, they can call parents immediately.

On the other hand, smartphones also have bad things. Some students use smartphones to play games in class. They don't listen to teacher. It's not good for study. Also, some students use smartphones to chat with friends. They waste time.

In my opinion, I think students can use smartphones in school, but they should use it correctly. School can make some rules. For example, students can only use smartphones in break time. They cannot use it in class.
