With the development of technology, smartphones have become an important part of our daily life. Many students own smartphones. Whether students should be allowed to use smartphones in school has become a hot topic.

On the one hand, smartphones can bring convenience to students. They can use smartphones to search for information when they meet problems in study. In addition, smartphones help students keep in touch with their parents, which is important in emergency situations.

On the other hand, smartphones may cause some problems. Some students may use them to play games during class, which will affect their study. Moreover, spending too much time on smartphones may be harmful to students' eyesight and health.

In my opinion, students can use smartphones in school under certain rules. Schools should make clear regulations about when and where students can use smartphones.
