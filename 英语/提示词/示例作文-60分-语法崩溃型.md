Smartphone is very popular in nowadays. Every student have smartphone. In school, student should use smartphone or not? This is big problem.

First, smartphone is help for student. When student not know some thing, he can use smartphone search. Very fast find answer. And student can call parent when something bad happen. This is important.

But, smartphone have many bad. Some student play game in class time. They not listening teacher. Study become not good. Student also use smartphone talk with friend, not do homework. Waste many time.

I think student can use smartphone in school. But teacher should tell student how use. Only break time can use, class time cannot use. This way is good.
